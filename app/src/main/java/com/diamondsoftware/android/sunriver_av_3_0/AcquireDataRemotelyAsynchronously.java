/**
 *  This class provides the means of fetching data in the 
 *  background (something that is required by Android when dealing with a fetch from the Internet).
 *  
 *  All it does is launch an AsyncTask, whose doInBackground method asks the requester (which implements the interface
 *  WaitingForDataAcquiredAsynchronously) to do the work of fetching the data.
 *  
 *  When the data is fetched, the onPostExecute (which executes on the UI thread, and so it is safe
 *  to update UI elements from it), then asks the requester to do what it needs to do with the data
 *  that has been fetched.
